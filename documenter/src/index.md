PeriDyn is a numerical simulation software designed to solve peridynamics problems. It is written in the Julia programming language, and offers a high level of flexibility and speed. PDBenchmark is built on top of the PeriDyn package, which provides a number of predefined material models and benchmark problems. This allows users to quickly set up and run simulations, and compare their results to established benchmarks.

Peridynamics is a nonlocal continuum theory that can describe material failure and fracture without using the traditional concepts of stress and strain. Instead, it models a material as a collection of particles that interact through pairwise forces. These forces depend on the separation between particles, and can be used to simulate a wide range of materials, including brittle and ductile solids, fluids, and granular materials.
